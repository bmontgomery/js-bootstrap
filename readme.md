# JS Application Bootstrap

This project simply defines some common-sense defaults for starting development on a JavaScript application. It is quick and dirty, and takes dependencies on very few things.

## Dependencies

- Node.js
- Express

## How to use

Start the application by navigating to the directory in a command line console, and typing

    node index.js

Then open a browser and point it to [http://localhost:3000/index.html](http://localhost:3000/index.html) and you should see a message indicating the application is running successfully.

## Start development

There is an "index.html" file in the "public" directory and an "app.js" file in the "javascript" directory. These are your starting points.
